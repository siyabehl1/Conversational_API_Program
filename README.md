# Conversational_API_Program
This project enables users to engage in interactive conversations with the Wolfram Alpha API. Users can continuously ask questions until they decide to exit the conversation. The conversation history, which includes the questions asked and their corresponding answers, will be saved to a file. This feature facilitates efficient research by allowing users to save their inquiries and results for later reference. The program also features an option that lets users choose which pods and subpods they would like to explore in detail for their query, instead of displaying random ones. Additionally, users have the option to save any images from their queries to their computer.
